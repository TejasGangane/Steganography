# 🖼️ Steganography Web App

A modern web-based tool that lets you **hide secret messages inside images** using Steganography. This application runs entirely in your browser, with no server-side storage or processing. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and optionally React for modular structure.

## 📖 What is Steganography?

**Steganography** is the technique of hiding information within another medium so that the presence of the message is concealed. In this project, we hide a **text message** inside the **least significant bits (LSBs)** of an image’s pixels.

Unlike encryption which hides the content, **steganography hides the existence** of the message itself.
